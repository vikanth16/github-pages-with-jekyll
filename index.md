Hello! I'm glad you are here. 

I am working as Mechatronics Engineer at Flexiv Robotics<link>. My work involves design and testing of novel series elastic actuators (SEAs) used in collaborative robotics. 

I received my Masters in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University. I worked with Prof. Jitesh Panchal in the areas of Systems Engineeing and Human-centric design.

Prior to joining Masters, I worked as a Project Engineer for a period of 2 years at an industrial automation and robotics start-up, Systemantics, based out of Bengaluru, India.
